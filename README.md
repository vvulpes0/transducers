# Transducers

A Haskell module is provided that uses the Language Toolkit
to decide whether a given finite-state transducer is input strictly local.
An extension of the tabular AT&T format of machines is implemented
in order to more conveniently allow for multiletter outputs,
prefixes, and suffixes.

There is not much to see here yet.
